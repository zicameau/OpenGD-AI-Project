## About The Project

![Stereo Madness running in OpenGD](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/847950548921614366/1086798200146497647/6046uyhlekoa1.png "OpenGD")


OpenGD is an open-source implementation of the popular game Geometry Dash. Our main goal is to remake the gameplay 1:1, while also improving performance through new engine features and C++ enhancements. We also plan to implement multithreading in the future.

## Status 

We are currently rewriting the gameplay from the ground up, **levels are not playable at the moment**.

### Built With

OpenGD is powered by [axmol](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol), which is maintained a fork of cocos2dx 4.0 that adds many new features and improvements over the original cocos2dx. The original Geometry Dash is also made with cocos2dx, but with a much older version from 2014.

## Build instructions

Required:
- Powershell
- CMake
- C++20 Compiler (MSVC, clang or gcc)


<details>

  <summary>Windows</summary>

### Quick start

Clone axmol, run setup.ps1 and restart cmd for command line variables to update
```
git clone https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol
cd axmol
./setup.ps1
```

In the OpenGD folder, build with cmake as usual
```
cmake -B build_x64
cmake --build build_x64 --config RelWithDebInfo
```

> **Warning**
> VS 2019 might not work on Windows, VS 2022 is recommended


### Recommended setup: VSCode

Required:
  - Ninja
  - clang (llvm)
  - cmake-tools extension
  - c/c++ extension

Recommended: [sccache](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache) (faster re-builds)

Make sure ninja and clang are on path!

From cmake-tools select configuration `Ninja default` or `Ninja sccache`, then build with cmake-tools or `cmake --build build`.

The VSCode setup provides support for intellisense and debugger (requires vs2022)

To actually run the game you will need the resources from the 2.2/2.1 version of Geometry Dash.
